# Tiki App

*We’re all users and in it together.*

**No** secrets.  **Real** transparency. **Open source** by design.

Everything that we do in our app is here. And you are welcome to explore it and contribute.

#### Our Mission

We’re building a fair, user-centric, decentralized system, giving the users control of their data. 
It’s **your** data; you deserve the right to see, control, and monetize it. Your data does not belong to corporations, **TIKI included**! 
We build tools to protect users from exploitation, greed, and carelessness. We build tools to **empower** users.

#### Our values
- **TRANSPARENCY** helps build trust. Seeing is believing, and nothing is off-limits. No shadowbans or secret algorithms at TIKI.
- **COMMUNITY** is what connects us. Together, we're an unstoppable force. We expect better. We demand better.
- **DIVERSITY** is not optional within the walls of TIKI. We're here for our users; we represent our users
- **SUSTAINABILITY** comes before profit. We work tirelessly to bring lasting positive change to our users' lives.
- **RELIABILITY** is foundational to trust. We want our users to count on us and aim never to break that trust.
